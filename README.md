# Diagnosing-Panic-Disorder-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
Investigated the applicability of various machine learning algorithms for diagnosing panic disorder using an open-access database with 120,000 records and multiple attributes related to panic attacks.
Employed models- Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Achieved near-perfect results in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score with models Gradient Boosting Classifier & SVM.
Identified the most effective machine learning algorithms for diagnosing panic disorder, providing insights for future development of diagnostic tools in mental health.
